<p><em>First Step: Load SMS from iPhone.</em> In this version you can choose to load your text messages via SFTP or using the iTunes Backup Directory.</p>
<p>Using SFTP:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect the pc and the iPhone to the same WLAN / LAN.</li>
<li>Just retrieve the ip of the iPhone and put it in the requested field.</li>
<li>The User name and the password are set yet because they are the default. If you have changed them just rewrite them in the requested fields.</li>
<li>Now what you have to do is click on the button “Load Sms From iPhone” and wait just a little bit.</li>
<li>Now the table is full of you messages and if you want to read one message just double click on the row that represents the message you want to read.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using iTunes Backup Directory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on “Load SMS from Backup” button.</li>
<li>Choose the iTunes backup directory of the iPhone backup frome where you want  to retrieve your text messages.</li>
<li>Wait a few seconds until the table is full of your messages.</li>
<li>If you want to read one message just double click on the row that represents the message you want to read.</li>
<li><strong>In this version, the application works ONLY ON *.mddata files. I hope the next release will work on *.mdbackup.</strong></li>
<li>On Vista the iTunes backup directory is under <strong>C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\</strong></li>
<li>On Windows Xp the iTunes backup directory is under <strong>C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup</strong></li>
<li>On MacOSX the iTunes backup directory is under <strong>USERNAME/Library/Application Support/Mobile Sync/Backup/</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Second Step: Exporting Messages. </em>Once you have loaded your messages, there are two ways to export your messages. The first is in TXT format, the second one is in the HTML format.</p>
<p>TXT format:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on “Export to TXT” button.</li>
<li>Choose the directory where you want to save your file .txt with you exported messages and click OK.</li>
<li>Now you have just created the file .txt of your exported messages. Just go to the directory where you saved it and take a look.</li>
</ul>
<p>HTML format:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on “Export to HTML” button.</li>
<li>Choose the directory where you want to save your exported messages in html format and click OK.</li>
<li>If you choose to save your messages in this way, the result is a very static site that shows you some stats in the index.html file and shows your conversations as the iPhone app SMS shows you.</li>
<li>Go to the directory you have just created and open the index.html with your favorite browser.</li>
